* Basic customization
- Most of the time, you won’t need to customize the DRF GUI at all
- DRF uses the Bootstrap CSS framework
- If you do want to customize the DRF GUI, most often it will be to show your own branding

* Swagger UI
- Swagger is a third-party tool that generates a browsable API from an OpenAPI specification
- This is an open standard, so many different APIs can generate API documents in the correct format, and use Swagger to build the UI
- Consider providing a Swagger UI that other developers will be more familiar with than DRF’s built-in one
