* Why do we want a computer to be able to “read” a web page?
- To be able to interact with it using a different interface
- Usually a mobile application, but also different web applications that you, or others, may build.

* REST
- REST stands for REpresentation State Transfer
- Any system designed in such a way can be described as RESTful.
- It uses of standard HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT and DELETE), and consistent (and optionally hierarchical) URL
- The responses should be some kind of structured text, like JSON

* REST vs Non-REST
- REST is only geared towards web applications. And mostly deals with HTTP requests and responses
