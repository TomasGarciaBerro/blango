* Intro To Django Registration
- Third-party library 
- Provides URLs, views and forms to support registration
- Supports both a “one-step” workflow, and a “two-step activation” workflow
- The key for the two-step activation workflow actually contains the username in an encoded format
- By decoding the key and checking when the user signed up request can be validated without any extra data needing to be stored in the database

* Profile View
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required
@login_required
- Overriding the look
- Move blango_auth to be before django.contrib.admin in the INSTALLED_APPS setting

* Django Registration One-Step Workflow
pip install django_registration
path('accounts/', include('django_registration.backends.one_step.urls')),
- We need to add some templates for Django Registration to render
django_registration/registration_form.html
django_registration/registration_complete.html
django_registration/registration_closed.html
(Gives the ability to disable registration by adding REGISTRATION_OPEN = False to your settings.py)
- If we are using a custom User model
- We have to create a RegistrationForm subclass and set the model class to the custom User model

* Two-Step Activation Workflow
- Todo muy parecido salvo que
- registration_complete.html: Instead of being shown when a user’s account is active, it’s shown after the user has completed the register form
- And should have a message letting them know they should check their email to complete registration.
- Other templates
django_registration/activation_failed.html
django_registration/activation_complete.html
django_registration/activation_email_subject.txt
django_registration/activation_email_body.txt
- URL pattern (No Custom User Model)
path('accounts/', include('django_registration.backends.activation.urls')),
- URL pattern (Custom User Model)
from django_registration.backends.activation.views import RegistrationView
from blango_auth.forms import BlangoRegistrationForm
urlpatterns = [
    …
    path(
        "accounts/register/",
        RegistrationView.as_view(form_class=BlangoRegistrationForm),
        name="django_registration_register",
    ),
    path("accounts/", include("django_registration.backends.activation.urls")),
    …
]
- Settings
ACCOUNT_ACTIVATION_DAYS = 7
