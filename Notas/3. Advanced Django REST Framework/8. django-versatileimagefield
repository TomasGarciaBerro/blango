* Intro
- Django has its own ImageField model field, designed to make it easy to attach an image to your model
- The ImageField itself just stores a path to the file in the database
- django-versatileimagefield is a library that provides a drop-in replacement for ImageField: VersatileImageField
versatileimagefield.fields.VersatileImageField
- It provides helper methods to generate thumbnails, crop images, and apply filters
- PPOIField: Primary Point of Interest
- Stores the coordinates of the “point of interest” of the image
- To use an ImageField in a template, we’d access its url attribute
<img src="{{ post.hero_image.url }}"/>
<img src="{{ post.hero_image.crop.100x100.url }}"/>
<img src="{{ post.hero_image.thumbnail.100x100.url }}"/>

* Set it up
pip3 install django-versatileimagefield
