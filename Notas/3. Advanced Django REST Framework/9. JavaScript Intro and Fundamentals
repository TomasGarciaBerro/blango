* Including JavaScript on a page
- Inline inside an HTML file
<script>
    console.log('Hello, world!')
</script>
- Include JavaScript from an external file
<script src="/static/js/script.js"></script>
- <script>s are included at the end of the page because of the references

* Variables in JavaScript
- Use let for variables whose value might change
- Use const for variables whose value won’t
- const values can’t be reassigned
- const are allowed to be mutated (add items to an array)
- var is an old way -> it isnt recommended

* Syntax
- Lines can optionally be terminated with a semicolon (;)
- Strings can use double or single quotes
- if statement
if (name === 'Ben') {
    benCount = 1
}
- === means that the types of the items being compared are taken into comparison
- single-line comments in JavaScript start with a //
- This is not valid, it is being redefined not reasigned
let fruitCount = 5
let fruitCount = 6
- object keys don’t need to be quoted
{Apple: 0, 'Banana': 1}
- dict en JS se llaman Objects
