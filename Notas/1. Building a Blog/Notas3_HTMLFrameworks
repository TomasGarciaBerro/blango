HTML Frameworks

* Bootstrap
- "The most popular HTML, CSS and JS library in the world.". 
- Includes many different components and Javascript functionality for interactivity.
* Foundation
- The "most advanced responsive front-end framework in the world". 
- While not as popular as Bootstrap some people prefer it for its semantic markup and mobile-first approach.

* Bulma
- Newer than Bootstrap and Foundation, and is more lightweight. 
It’s not as full-featured and doesn’t include its own Javascript helpers, so you’ll need to write your own for interaction.

* Tailwind CSS
- Growing in popularity and loved for its utility approach to classnames and its small size. 
- Like Bulma, you’ll need to provide your own Javascript.

* Import Bootstrap CSS
- In the <head>

*Import Bootstrap Javascript files
- At the end od the <body>
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.2/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-EVSTQN3/azprG1Anm3QDgpJLIm9Nao0Yz1ztcQTwFspd3yD65VohhpuuCOmLASjC" crossorigin="anonymous">
